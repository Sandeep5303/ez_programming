# Welcome to ez_programming page

Here i'll post some random coding questions and their solutions\
Most of the questions are done in python language

 ```python
  a,b = 1,10
for i in range(a+1,b):
    for j in range(2, int(i ** .5) + 1):
        if i % j == 0: # if number is divisble by any of the number ranging from 2 to its square root, then it is
            # not a prime number
            break
    else:
        print(i,end=" ") # print prime number if found
```
